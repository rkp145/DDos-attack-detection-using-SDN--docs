# DDos-Attack-Detection-Using-SDN-Network
Implemented an entropy‐based detection method for software‐ defined networks (SDN) using Python and the POX controller. Ana‐ lyzed multiple entropy values from incoming packets collected via OpenSwitch, evaluated performance, and utilized Mininet for net‐ work simulation and understanding.

Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop and test a novel detection method that uses entropy calculations to identify anomalies in network traffic. By leveraging the capabilities of SDN, we can dynamically monitor and respond to potential security threats.

#Features

- Entropy-Based Detection: Utilizes multiple entropy values for detecting anomalies in network traffic.
- POX Controller Integration: Collects incoming packets via OpenSwitch using the POX controller.
- Performance Evaluation: Analyzes the performance of the detection method based on entropy calculations.
- Mininet Simulation: Employs Mininet for simulating network environments and testing the detection method.

 Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- POX controller
- Mininet
- OpenSwitch
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`

 Steps

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Install Dependencies.
3. Set Up Mininet.
4. Run POX Controller.
